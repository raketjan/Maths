## Math

It's time to brush up on my math skills from yesteryear. I will follow the format outlined in the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/math?utm_source=chatgpt.com) github repo, starting with the Coursera course 
[Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking/). It is supposed to take 10 weeks, and I started it today (January 5 2025). So far I have listened to lecture 1, and read the "Background material".
